Microbat data from Threlfall et al Journal of Applied Ecology 'Increasing biodiversity in urban green spaces through simple vegetation interventions',,,,,
For data collection methods see above paper.,,,,,
site = green space site (n=39). Tree = density of trees.ha (>80cm dbh). Vvol = understorey volume. Nat = proportion of native plants. Treenat = density of large native trees. Treeexo = density of large exotic trees.,,,,,
